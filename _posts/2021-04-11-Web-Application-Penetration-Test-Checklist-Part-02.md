**In this article I am going to share a checklist which you can use when you are doing a penetration test on a website, you can also use this list as a reference in bug bounties. This list is made for intermediates, so they can look it for reference.**

*Before starting this list I want to make a request that this is my advice that you should complete the previous [checklist](https://thehackedsite.netlify.app/bug/bounty/2021/04/10/web-application-penetration-test-checklist-part-01), so in this process you will not get confused.*

***You are not genius!!*** *Remember this thing, so if you donâ€™t understand something just Google about it and so some research, I also donâ€™t know everything and there could be things that I have missed, so donâ€™t worry and keep learning.*

#### ðŸ“‹ The list
1. Test for credentials transported over encryption.
    - When you submit your login/registration data try intercepting the request and changing the requests method. `POST` to `GET`, and `GET` to `POST`. If any points of time you find the data submitted by user are transported without encryption you can make this as low-level bug.
2. Test for default credentials on admin page/console or any sign in panel.
    - Try submitting default username passwords like `admin`:`admin`, `admin`:`password`
3. Bypassing the authentication. 
    - Forced browsing: Directly visiting the section of the website which requires authentication. For example, if you have to login at https://testwebsite.com/login to visit https://testwebsite.com/information, but if you can visit https://testwebiste.com/information directly just by typing this URL in the browser without authenticating then this will be known as forced browsing.
    - Parameter modification: Try changing response which comes from the server for example, if your server response https://testwebsite.com/auth=false then try changing the parameter `auth=false` to `auth-true`.
    - Session ID brute forcing.
    - SQL injection. 
4. Check for broken access control.
5. Remember password checking.
    - Check that is password being stored in the cookies or being constantly transferred in every request of the website. The credentials should only be sent I login phase.
6. Check for directory traversal includes file input.
    - You have to check each and every input which your website and its directories take from user.
    - You can referrer to this [article](https://medium.com/@nerdy_researcher/directory-traversal-aka-path-traversal-c76dc7bbe61#:~:text=What%20is%20Directory%20Traversal%3F,and%20sensitive%20operating%20system%20files).
7. Checking for privilege escalation.
    - You can check for this at some places like if user can make payment, adding something, sending message to someone.
    - You can intercept request of two different sets of account and try modifying parameters like grp, id, and role if they exist.
    - You can referrer to this [article]( https://shahjerry33.medium.com/privilege-escalation-hello-admin-a53ac14fd388).
8. Check for IDOR *(Insecure Direct Object Reference)*.
    - You can try for getting access to other user data by changing parameters in URL.
9. Check for bypassing session management object.
    - Set-cookies are secure or not?
    - Are cookies transmitted in encrypted manner?
    - Make sure cookies are not same every time when your browse website.
    - Sometimes website can leak their token structure/information try to find it.
    - Session ID predictability.
    - Brute forcing session ID.
10. Check for CSRF.
11. Check for XSS *(stored, reflected, blind)*.
12.	Check for SQL injection *(blind, In band, Out band, Error based etc.).*
13.	Check for XML injection.
14.	Check for file upload.
15.	Check for open redirection or client-side open redirection.
    - You can referrer to this [article](https://corneacristian.medium.com/top-25-open-redirect-bug-bounty-reports-5ffe11788794).
16.	Checking for web sockets vulnerabilities.
17.	Check for code execution. 
    - You can referrer to this [article](https://medium.com/@ashishrohra/remote-code-execution-explaination-writeups-and-tools-a8e4c3362259).
18.	Check for SSRF *(Server Side Request Forgery)*.
19.	Check fir command injection.
    - You can referrer to this [article](https://medium.com/ax1al/os-command-injection-beginners-guide-637e1eed1fde).
20.	Checking for business logic flaws.
    - You can referrer to this [article](https://medium.com/armourinfosec/exploiting-business-logic-vulnerabilities-234f97d6c4c0).
21.	Checking for LDAP injection.
    - You can referrer to this [article](https://medium.com/@hunter_55/ldap-admin-account-bypassed-2cc8b264d66e).
22.	Check for HTTP request smuggling. 

*So this was all about some more things to check while doing penetration test on a website or in a bug bounty program. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it.*
