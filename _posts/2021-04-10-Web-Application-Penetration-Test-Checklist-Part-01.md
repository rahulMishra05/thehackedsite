**In this article I am going to share a checklist which you can use when you are doing a penetration test on a website, you can also use this list as a reference in bug bounties. This is beginnerâ€™s friendly list, so they can look it for reference.**

*Before stating the list I want to make something clear, that before you start using this list for finding bugs/vulnerabilities make sure that you have already completed the first step which is **Reconnaissance**. Otherwise you will find it hard to find bug/vulnerabilities.*

***You are not genius!!*** *Remember this thing, so if you donâ€™t understand something just Google about it and so some research, I also donâ€™t know everything and there could be things that I have missed, so donâ€™t worry and keep learning.*

#### General things to do 

1. Create 2 accounts on the same website if it has login functionality. You can use this [extension]( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) to use same browser for creating different accounts on the same website.
2. Try directory forcing using tools like **Dirsearch**, **FeroBuster**, **Ffuf**, might be possible some directory may reveal sensitive information.

#### Login page
1. Session expiration 
2. Improper session validation 
3. OAuth bypass *(it includes features like login with Google, Microsoft, Instagram or any)*
    - OAuth token stealing
    - Authentication bypass
    - Privilege escalation
    - SQLi

#### Registration page
1. XML file upload using SVG *(if website asks for documents upload or profile upload then you can try this)*
2. Bypassing limitation on file types to upload *(if they just allow jpg, png then try to upload `.php` or `.py`)*
3. Bypassing mobile or email verification
4. Brute forcing OTP sent
5. Try inserting XSS payload whenever possible *(like If you can enter payload in first name/last name/address etc text box makes sure to enter because sometimes it may reflects somewhere else or maybe itâ€™s stored XSS)*.

#### Forgot password page
1. Password reset poisoning *(kind of similar way we do host header injection)*
2. Reset token/link expiring *(maybe they pay)*
3. Reset token leaks *(this can happen when some website interacts to third party services at that point of time maybe password reset token is sent via referrer part and maybe it can leak)*
4. Check for sub-domain takeover.
5. Check for older version of service is being used by your target and if they so try to find existing exploit for the target.

*So this was all about some basic things to check while doing penetration test on a website or in a bug bounty program. Hope you liked it and learned something new from it.*
