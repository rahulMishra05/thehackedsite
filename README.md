# The Hacked Site

This is my blog mainly focused on programming, cyber security and bug hunting. 

A blog webiste is a very good medium to convey your thoughts and opinions to the community or any specific group of people. By this tech blog my goal is to explore more things in the field of cyber security, and I also want to discover more enthusiastic people in this feild.

### About Me
I am engineering student from computer science. Life in engineering is little bit tough but also fun at the same time üòÖ

My main work domain is penetration testing, inspite of that I also have decent knowledge of web development. Actually I started from web development but latter after exploring it and other fields like mobile application development and decentralized app development, I shifted my carrer to cyber security.

That's not all of I also like to do some stuff other than coding, such as I like to play football, cricket and other than that I like movies too.

That's all about me, you can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_mishra10), [Telegram](https://t.me/rahul_mishra10), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-mishra-66210b185), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rahul_mishra10/?hl=en) and can share your thoughts about this webiste or opinion about it and anything you want to share.
